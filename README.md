Fluidchen is a CFD Solver developed for the CFD Lab taught at TUM Informatics, Chair of Scientific Computing in Computer Science.

After forking, use this `README.md` however you want: feel free to remove anything you don't need,
or add any additional details we should know to run the code.

## Working with fluidchen

You will extend this code step-by-step starting from a pure framework to a parallel CFD solver. Please follow these [instructions for work with git and submitting the assignments](docs/first-steps.md).

## Software Requirements

This code is known to work on all currently supported Ubuntu LTS versions (22.04, 20.04, 18.04).
In particular, you will need:

- A recent version of the GCC compiler. Other compilers should also work, but you may need to tweak the CMakeLists.txt file (contributions welcome). GCC 7.4, 9.3, and 11.2 are known to work. See `CMakeLists.txt` and `src/Case.cpp` for some compiler-specific code.
- CMake, to configure the build.
- The VTK library, to generate result files. libvtk7 and libvtk9 are known to work.
- OpenMPI (not for the skeleton, but when you implement parallelization).

Get the dependencies on Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libvtk7-qt-dev openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev
```
## Code Theory

For our 2D test case, we assume the fluid is viscous and follows the Navier-Stokes equations. Let,
`U` be the velocity in X-direction,
`V` be the velocity in Y-direction,
`p` be the pressure

## Application of Boundary Conditions

## Timestep Calculation

## Discretization

## Calculation of fluxes and velocity 

## Calculation of pressure

## Plotting Residuals
The functionality of pressure residuals plotting was added to enable user monitor the health of the simulation on the fly. To plot the residuals alongside the running simulation, first copy the `Residuals.txt` from the root folder to the `build` folder. After starting the simulation, open terminal and run `gnuplot Residuals.txt` from build. This would start plotting of the Residuals alognside the simulation.  

## Building the code

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.lrz.de/oguzziya/GroupX_CFDLab.git
cd GroupX_CFDLab
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

After `make` completes successfully, you will get an executable `fluidchen` in your `build` directory. Run the code from this directory.
Note: Earlier versions of this documentation pointed to the option of `make install`. You may want to avoid this and directly work inside the repository while you develop the code.

### Build options

By default, **fluidchen** is installed in `DEBUG` mode. To obtain full performance, you can execute cmake as

```shell
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
```

or

```shell
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O3" ..
```

You can see and modify all CMake options with, e.g., `ccmake .` inside `build/` (Ubuntu package `cmake-curses-gui`).

A good idea would be that you setup your computers as runners for [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
(see the file `.gitlab-ci.yml` here) to check the code building automatically every time you push.

## Running

In order to run **Fluidchen**, the case file should be given as input parameter. Some default case files are located in the `example_cases` directory. Navigate to the `build/` directory and run:

```shell
./fluidchen ../example_cases/LidDrivenCavity/LidDrivenCavity.dat
```

This will run the case file and create the output folder `../example_cases/LidDrivenCavity/LidDrivenCavity_Output`, which holds the `.vtk` files of the solution.

If the input file does not contain a geometry file (added later in the course), fluidchen will run the lid-driven cavity case with the given parameters.

### No rule to make target '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so'

We are investigating an [issue](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-i05/public/fluidchen-skeleton/-/issues/3) that appears on specific systems and combinations of dependencies.
